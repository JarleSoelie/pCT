# pCT

This will prepare the simulation proton data for the DROP-TVS pCT reconstruction algorithm! Not the reconstruction itself... 

Like with the pRad, you start with the **createTree.cc**, then you filter using either **filterSS.cc** or **filterDS.cc**, before building the binaries for the DROP-TVS to reconstruct in **binary.cc**.
